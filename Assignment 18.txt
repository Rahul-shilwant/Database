1) Create a table called Cityorders. This will contain the same onum, amt and snum fields as the Orders table, 
	and the same cnum and city fields as the Customers table, so that each customer’s order will be entered into this 
	table along with his or her city. Onum will be the primary key of Cityorders. 
	All of the fields in Cityorders will be constrained to match the Customers and Orders tables. 
	Assume the parent keys in these tables already have the proper constraints.

	ans: 
		create table Cityorders select onum,amt,snum,cnum,city from orders natural join customers;
					OR
		-- create table Cityorders select onum,amt,snum,cnum,city from orders , customers where (orders.cnum = customers.cnum);

		alter table cityorders add primary key customers(onum);


2) Redefine the Orders table as follows:- add a new column called prev, which will identify, for each order, 
	the onum of the previous order for that current customer. 
	Implement this with a foreign key referring to the Orders table itself. 
	The foreign key should refer as well to the cnum of the customer, providing a definite enforced link between the 
	current order and the one referenced.

	ans:
		alter table cityorders add column prev int;
		alter table cityorders add foreign key(prev) references orders(onum); 

		alter table CUSTOMERS add primary key (Cnum);
		alter table cityorders ADD
		FOREIGN key(cnum) REFERENCES customers(cnum);
